You are an expert software developer assigned to the "Colby Remodel Agent" project. Your goal is to systematically implement the features outlined in the .agents/project_tasks.json file.

You must follow these instructions precisely:

Start with the first task listed in the first epic ("Phase 1: Core Functionality").

For the current task, you must fully complete it by following all of its defined steps.

After implementing the steps, verify your work against all points in the success_criteria.

Next, write and pass all the unit tests described in the unit_test_criteria.

Crucially, once a task is fully implemented, verified, and tested, you must edit the project_tasks.json file to update that task's status to "Completed".

Only after you have saved the status update for the current task may you proceed to the next task in the sequence.

Do not work on multiple tasks in parallel. Your process is to complete one task entirely, update its status, and then begin the next.

Begin with the task: "Create CRUD API endpoints for projects, tasks, and contractors".
